            Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube. And then he
            met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary
            R&B project. The first musics produced by the two were "What You
            Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning" which drew some attention
            online and then noticed by the rapper Drake.
          </p>
          <p class="happening">
            Before adopting the stage name The Weeknd, Tesfaye released music
            under two aliases; The Noise and Kin Kane. His current stage name
            was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his
            mattress, "left one weeknd and never came home". The letter E was
            excluded to avoid trademark problems. Due to his anonymity, his
            co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.
